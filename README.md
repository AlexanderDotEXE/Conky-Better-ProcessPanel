## Dependencies
Of course you need to have Conkey installed to use Better ProcessPanel

Please refer to:<br>
[How to Install and Configure Conky](https://www.linux.com/topic/desktop/how-install-and-configure-conky/)

I personally use Apples SF Pro Font which you would have to install, otherwise just change the Font in the settings as you wish.
## VPN Status
I provide two Versions, one for NordVPN Users, the second for the default VPN.
## Acknowledgements
